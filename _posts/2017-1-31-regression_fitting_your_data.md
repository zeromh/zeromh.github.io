title: Regression - Finding a Function to Fit Your Data
---

Here's a simple dataset - two variables we'll call \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).

It looks like \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are related! Let's say we want to use \\( x \\) to predict \\( y \\). We can use regression to fit a function to the data. Here it is:

![x,y scatter plot with regression line](/images/straight_line.png)

This data was easy to fit, because for every unit increase in \\( x \\), \\( y \\) also increases some proportionate amount. The equation for the above line is \\( y=2x \\), so we know that for every unit increase in \\( x \\), \\( y \\) increases by about 2.

What do we do when fitting the data isn't so easy, such as when our data looks like this?

The equation for this function is \\( y=81.6-.1x \\), and it **doesn't** fit the data very well. Rather than \\( y \\) varying as a function of \\( x \\), it looks like \\( y \\) varies as a function of **\\( x^2 \\)**. This means we want to look for a function of the form \\( y=\beta\_0+\beta\_1x+\beta\_2x^2 \\). Our regression software will take care of finding the best \\( \beta \\) values; we just need to give it an \\( x \\) variable **as well as** an \\( x^2 \\) variable to work with.

So I square my \\( x \\) values, and now I have data that looks like this:

I run regression to predict \\( y \\) in terms of these two other variables, and I get:

That worked pretty well!

The principle here is to try and understand how my \\( y \\) variable varies as a function of my \\( x \\) variables, and then transform my \\( x \\)'s to match that function.

Sometimes, having an understanding of the subject matter that you're dealing with can help you do this. Take a look at one more example using some made-up data:

![x1, x2, y scatter plot](/images/scatter_3d.png)

Imagine this data comes from a psychology experiment where participants complete tasks of varying difficulty after being kept awake for varying numbers of hours. The experimenter measures how participant response time (in milliseconds) on the tasks changes as a function of task difficulty and sleep deprivation. (Note that we have to visualize this in 3-D, because we now have three variables.)

If we wanted to make predictions based on this data, we would try to predict **response time** (our \\( y \\) variable) using **task difficulty** and **sleep deprivation** (our two \\( x \\) variables).

Let's again use regression to fit a function to this data without doing any kind of transformation beforehand. Here's what we get:

![x1, x2, y scatter plot with regression plane](/images/straight_plane.png)

The equation for this plane is \\( y=22.6x\_1+14x\_2+316.1 \\), and as you were probably expecting, it isn't a good fit. The bottom right corner of the plane is too high, whereas the top right corner is too low to fit the data correctly.

An experienced researcher might guess that there is an **interaction** between your \\( x \\)) variables. This would mean that, say, task difficulty influences response time, but it influences response time **even more** when you're sleep deprived. Mathematically, an interaction would look something like \\( y=\beta\_0+\beta\_1x+\beta\_2x^2+\beta\_3x\_1x\_2 \\). Notice the last term of the equation has \\( x\_1 \\) and \\( x\_2 \\) multiplied by each other.

Let's add an interaction term to our data, then, and see how it fits. As before, this is as simple as creating a new variable that is the product of of \\( x\_1 \\) and \\( x\_2 \\). When we run regression on our \\( x\_1 \\), \\( x\_2 \\), and \\( x\_1x\_2 \\) variables, we get:
